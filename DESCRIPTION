Title: Enabling stream processing of large files
Version: 1.20.0
Author: Martin Morgan, Nishant Gopalakrishnan
Maintainer: Martin Morgan <martin.morgan@roswellpark.org>
Description: Large data files can be difficult to work with in R,
    where data generally resides in memory. This package encourages a
    style of programming where data is 'streamed' from disk into R via
    a `producer' and through a series of `consumers' that, typically
    reduce the original data to a manageable size. The package
    provides useful Producer and Consumer stream components for
    operations such as data input, sampling, indexing, and
    transformation; see package?Streamer for details.
