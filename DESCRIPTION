Description: Large data files can be difficult to work with in R,
  where data generally resides in memory. This package encourages a
  style of programming where data is 'streamed' from disk into R
  through a series of streams that, typically reduce the original data
  to a manageable size. The package provides useful Producer and
  Consumer stream components for operations such as data input,
  sampling, indexing, and transformation; see package?Streamer for
  details.
