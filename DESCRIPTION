Description: Large data files can be difficult to work with in R,
  where data generally resides in memory. This package encourages a
  style of programming where data is 'streamed' from disk into R via a
  `producer' and through a series of `consumers' that, typically
  reduce the original data to a manageable size. The package provides
  useful Producer and Consumer stream components for operations such
  as data input, sampling, indexing, and transformation; see
  package?Streamer for details.
